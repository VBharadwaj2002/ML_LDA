# ML_LDA
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a technique used to separate classes by finding a linear combination of features that maximizes the distance between class means while minimizing variance within each class.
This involves like maximising the distance between the centers of the two classes and th einter class variance size. Variance/Covariance defines how the two independent varaibles co-vary with each other.
